	<h3>So what even is Freemode Wars?</h3>
	<p>Whether youre a current or former player, or even if you've never played the game and only hear or see from others' experience, then you'll know how crazy things can get. For those that are unfamiliar with GTA Online, when launching online, your character is spawned in an apartment/garage (if you own one). From there the player is free to partake in any activity, mission, race, deathmatch etc. that they please. Players that remain in freemode however can still partake in Freemode events. However, the game punishes players for killing other players and being a nuisance by increasing their mental state and making them lucrative prey for other players, as eliminating them will result in them gaining extra reputation points. Whilst this is a good countermeasure for "griefers", players that wish to try out new weapons ad challenge other crews without a time or score limit may find limited options. Freemode Wars allows for teams of 1-6 players to duel with other crews. NO TIME LIMIT. Players can equip the weapons that they have already unlocked. Future updates will allow for weapon limitations or equal weapon distribution. The scoreboard for Freemode Wars will display the individual/ team with the most kills</p>

			<h1>Why Freemode Wars</h1>
		</div>
   
   		
  <p>Freemode Wars aims to alleviate the limitations and drawbacks of regular freemode sessions, but maintaining the chaos and substance that GTA is known for.  Freemode Wars can be used as an alternative for those who do not wish to spend time joining heists or adversary modes and want to improve their PvP skills. Just like heists, Freemode Wars will require players to plan and stage out various strategies and tactics. </p>

			<h1>Release Date</h1>
		</div>
		

		<p>Due to the fact that GTA Online has been around for almost 5 years  at the time of this publication, the online community has consistently received high-quality update after high quality update, and has one of the highest player counts on console and PC. Because of this, we at Orange House Studios, wish to give the everyone from hardcore fans to casual players alike, a new but familiar experience to GTA Online. The game is in the planning phase and we aim to gain as much feedback from the fans as possible. We aim to release Freemode Wars to players in late 2018/early 2019. </p>
